## More Rigorous Software Engineering Would Improve Reproducibility in Machine Learning Research

Source code for our [position paper on software engineering in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00902).
An example template repository for most concepts discussed in the paper is available [here](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-with-Jax/day_01_exercise_intro/tree/main). 

### Getting Started
First of all, we have to clone this repository,
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:BonnBytes/position_we_need_more_tests_in_ml.git
```
In the next step, you need to configure an environment to use the code in this project. 
To do that, create a `.env`-file with the following content.

``` bash
PYTHONPATH=.
OPENREVIEW_USERNAME=YOUR_OPENREVIEW_ACCOUNT_NAME
OPENREVIEW_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
```


### Reusability
After cloning and navigating into this repository, you can install the code in this repository via pip.

``` bash
pip install .
```

### Download the data run
To aggregate the statistical data we used for the paper, run the command below.

``` bash
./run_all.sh
```

### Run the tests
Set up a dotenv with your openreview account credentials. Make sure you set the
`OPENREVIEW_USERNAME` and `OPENREVIEW_PASSWORD` variables correctly. To run the tests type
``` bash
nox -s test
```
into the console.


### Funding

The Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) supported research through its "BNTrAInee" (16DHBK1022) and "WestAI" (01IS22094A) projects.
